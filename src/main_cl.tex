\begin{cvletter}

	\lettersection{About me}

	Mi name is Alejandro Mantilla and I have Bachelor and Master of Science degrees in industrial engineering as well as a minor in mathematics, from University of the Andes, one of the top universities in Latin America. It is my passion for creating an impact through engineering and mathematics that drove me to become a teacher at my university, where for the past three years I taught at a postgraduate level and researched topics in data engineering, machine learning and statistics, and software development. Particularly, my research at the university was made with the objective of enabling researchers to develop and deploy data-driven tools to the cloud. Academic interests aside, I have practical experience in data engineering and business intelligence from the time I spent working at Intel Corporation. There, I was able to thoroughly influence our sales and marketing strategies, not only through deep insights into our data, but also by efficiently designing, developing, and managing data technologies such as databases, data pipelines, insightful dashboards, and web applications.

	Regarding my professional path, I spend a significant amount of time learning and sharpening my technical and analytical skills to the point that I take pride in my problem-solving abilities in the context of technological and strategic advances. Several of the projects initiated by me have seen great success despite their innovative nature and difficulty to integrate into a settled organization such as my university, Intel, and BetOnline. For example, I have taken advantage of my knowledge of cloud computing and web development to create tools that allow students to learn, develop, and test their programming knowledge, as well as allow the teaching team to track performance metrics individually and collectively. It is my goal to consistently improve as an engineer and to always bring something new and of impact to my peers.

	I am always looking to learn about our world: I enjoy learning new languages which is why I speak Spanish, English, and German fluently; I enjoy practicing sports, of which I enjoy kite-surfing the most; It is my love of nature that led me to try to live a more sustainable lifestyle, and to always be on the lookout for opportunities to positively influence those around me.


	\lettersection{Why Kellanova?}

	I am drawn to Kellanova due to its admirable commitment to develop unique and widely recognized food products at scale, and the challenges of efficiently using information such a goal would entail. I strongly believe that Kellanova's requirements to enable its business intelligence and analytics objectives are a good fit for my skills, experience, and passion for sustainable information practices.

	Throughout the years I've faced several engineering challenges which soon taught me that what I enjoy the most is to create, and learn from the process. Be it developing software, building mechanical contraptions or clumsily improvising on my guitar, I will always aim to create something new. I believe that Kellanova can provide an environment that could nourish this commitment to innovate, as well as grant me access to new knowledge in the topics of Big-Data, corporate data practices, and data governance, which I find intriguing.


	\lettersection{Why me?}

	Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a robust skill set that aligns well with the requirements of the data engineer role. My proficiency in, R, Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau has allowed me to effectively design, deploy, and manage essential tools to the operation of organizations I've made part of. I have leveraged these skills in my previous roles to streamline processes, improve operational efficiency, and enable informed decision-making.

	What sets me apart is my genuine passion for machine learning, big-data, and providing business insights. This commitment is evident in my academic pursuits, personal lifestyle, and practical experience. I have delved deeply into the industry practices in leveraging internal and external data sources, and identified that which I agree with the most, often advocating for the technologies that enable a true commitment to long-term impact. By approaching problems from a data-driven perspective, I have successfully identified opportunities for organizations to adopt practices that allow them to keep track of and directly influence their performance metrics and KPIs.

	Furthermore, my experience as a teacher has honed my ability to effectively communicate complex ideas and concepts to diverse audiences. I have had the privilege of sharing my knowledge and fostering a learning environment that promotes critical thinking and the development of problem-solving skills. These teaching experiences have strengthened my ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams, adapt to different work styles, and drive consensus among stakeholders.
